Node.js Project and Practice Repository

Welcome to my Node.js project and practice repository! Here you will find a collection of projects and exercises I have worked on using Node.js,
along with various technologies and frameworks associated with it.

About Node.js Node.js is a powerful and popular JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable and efficient server-side applications. 
It utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it ideal for handling concurrent requests and building real-time applications.
Repository Contents In this repository, you will find a diverse range of projects and exercises that showcase my experience and understanding of Node.js. 
Some of the key features and technologies explored include:

Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js, used for building robust APIs and web applications. MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database, 
often used with Node.js for persisting data in applications. Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the web clients and the server, 
perfect for building chat applications and collaborative tools. Authentication and Authorization: Implementation of user authentication and authorization using technologies such as Passport.js, 
JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OAuth. and many more
